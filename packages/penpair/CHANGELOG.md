# penpair

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 229c152: `penpair export --frames ID=NAME,... --page PAGE` exports several frames in one command and keeps going after a failed frame. `--cache` skips frames whose content fingerprint, scale and output file are unchanged.
- 229c152: `doctor --debug-port` and `wake` list the browser tabs on the Penpot origin and which one holds the pinned file. `wake --reload` reloads that one tab and waits for the plugin. Writer-lock errors name the holding run, operation, process and command. `penpair locks` lists local writer locks and `penpair locks clear` removes those whose process is gone.
- 229c152: Flush and layout failures now say what was pending: queued binds and styles, nodes sampled, the slowest bind and time per phase. The 30,000 ms budget maximum is named in the refusal, and malformed layout geometry names the offending shape.
- 229c152: New `@instances` kit (`--include @kit --include @instances`): `pp.swap` keeps position, texts and sizing, `pp.iconSize` scales nested shapes, `pp.componentName` returns the path with the name, and `pp.libraryIcon` places and recolours a library icon.
- 229c152: `penpair queue run jobs.json` runs an ordered list of journaled `run-file` jobs one at a time, with retries that resume uncertain runs, an optional `wake` after a lost connection, a saved status record and one status line per job. `penpair queue status` shows it offline.
- 229c152: `run-file` now checks layout only at the `layoutRoots` its inspect script reports, instead of sampling the whole page. A run with no roots reports the layout check as skipped, with the reason. `--layout-scope page` keeps the whole-page sample as an opt-in audit.
- 229c152: A journaled write whose readback already holds is reported as `already-satisfied` (with a warning and a `skipped` mark in the journal) instead of a verified write. Readback scripts now receive `CFG.inspection`, the inspection from before the write.
  
  The command result's own `outcome` is `already-satisfied` too (exit code 0), so a script that reads only the outer result does not mistake it for a write.
- 229c152: `penpair repair --page PAGE --empty-shapes` finds shapes without an id on the page root and, with `--apply`, asks Penpot to remove them, then recounts independently. A failed removal is reported, not claimed.
- 229c152: `run-file --stages N` runs a write script once per stage (`CFG.stage`), each stage a journal step that resumes from where it stopped. A stage is never skipped because its readback already passes.

### Patch Changes

- 229c152: Republishing a journey or integration map over an older drawing no longer exceeds the 90 KB snippet limit: the publish write carries a digest of the inspected projection instead of the projection. A raw `radius` value in the build kit now lists the active radius tokens.
